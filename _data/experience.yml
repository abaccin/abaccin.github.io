    When I started in Roomex the startup environment was still present, although the company had reached a state where more structure had to be put in place. My role consisted in setting up all the necessary standards patterns and practices to have a high performance engineering team, I was involved in building up the team rituals (stand ups, retros, etc.) but also ramping up the cicd pipeline and creating a culture obsessed with performance, code quality and best practices including infrastructure, code, security and data. 
    While expanding the team and establishing best practices I also introduced the company to cloud native paradigms, especially serverless, queues, topics and api gateways by starting the journey of the migration to a modular microservices architecture.
    I also helped to grow the team by screening, interviewing and giving green light to hire several backend and frontend engineers
